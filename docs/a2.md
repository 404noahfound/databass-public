## A2: Query Optimization

* Released: 9/17
* Due: 10/4 11:59PM EST
* Teams of 2


You will now implement Selinger join optimization in DataBass!  To do so, you will implement the dynamic programming optimization algorithm, as well as some basic cardinality and selectivity estimation.

Please read the [optimizer design doc](../databass/optimizer/README.md).  You will primarily modify code in [`databass/optimizer`](../databass/optimizer).

## The Assignment

#### Task 1: Cost Estimation

Please edit [`estimation.py`](../databass/optimizer/estimation.py) to implement selectivity estimation for attributes, predicates, and join operators.


#### Task 2: Selinger Optimization

Please edit [`selinger.py`](../databass/optimizer/selinger.py) to implement the join optimization logic.
We have included sample code in [`test.py`](../test.py) that runs and compares the two optimizers on randomly generate join plans.  Feel free to use it to aid debugging.

#### Evaluation

Since join optimization cannot be evaluated via a correct/incorrect judgement, we will evaluate your submissions via two criteria:

* Efficiency of selinger algorithm: the number of plans that are costed during Selinger optimization.   We expect it to be lower than the exhaustive algorithm, and within 10\% of our implementation of Selinger.  The test cases include our numbers as a sanity check.
* The wallclock time of your optimized plan, when run on our machines, should be within 10% of the plan that our implementation generates.

It is absolutely possible to do better than the reference implementation, since it uses naive statistics.

The tests can be run using:

      $ pytest test/a2.py
